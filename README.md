# Assignment-06 Interface Design
## Project Description 
The purpose of this interface design is to test out the multiple interface design ideas that can be implemented into the reconstruction of Alaska's Department of Fish and Game.
I previously created a wireframe that outlined the websites features in order for users to test out its usability, based on two tasks they were asked to complete. Now I will digitize the wireframe/wireflow in order to implement more design features (ex.Typography,Color Scheme,layout), so that I can run a user test and then see how much more I can adjust the designs on the webpage based on their feedback.
