# Assignment-06 Interface Design
## Project Description 
The purpose of this interface design is to test out the multiple interface design ideas that can be implemented into the reconstruction of Alaska's Department of Fish and Game.
I previously created a wireframe that outlined the websites features in order for users to test out its usability, based on two tasks they were asked to complete. Now I will digitize the wireframe/wireflow in order to implement more design features (ex.Typography,Color Scheme,Layout), so that I can run a user test and then see how much more I can adjust the designs on the webpage based on their feedback.  
## Typography 
Before finalizing a typeface I considered three variations for the Webpage. 

Roboto: <img src="Roboto .png" width="25%" length="25%"> Prompt: <img src="Prompt.png" width="25%" length="25%"> Bitter: <img src="Bitter.png" width="25%" length="25%">

I decided to go with "Bitter" this lead the font-size of the body text to be 16px, font-size of title text 32px, Font-size of subtitles 24px, font-size of button text and drop down menu 18px, font-size of categories 20px. I also added drop shadows to all clickable text along with text that can be hovered over to let users know that they can interact with it with the mouse.
